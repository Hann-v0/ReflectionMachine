# ReflectionMachine

This repo contains the results of the thesis 'The Functional Preference of Policemen when Using a Reflection Machine in Preventive Frisking'.

First, we included the application ('Application_RM.zip') implemented by Ana√Øs de Graaf and adjusted by Hannah Venhuizen.

Second, it contains a jupyter notebook including a result analysis of the data. In this notebook, both the data of the survey and application is included.

Third, it contains two excel files ('StudentExperiment.xlsx' and 'AgentExperiment.xlsx') in which the data is included, one for the student participants and one for the policemen.
Both the files contains both the raw data and the translated data. An information sheet is included to provide information about the tabs.

Finally, it contains the txt files which are the direct output of the application.
This can be found in the folder 'output_app'. The first letter indicates whether it was a student (s) or a policeman (p), then p* indicates which participant it indicates, then _** indicates the design format.
